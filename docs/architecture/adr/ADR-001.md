# ADR-001: Use TurboModules over Nitro Modules

**Date:** 2025-12-31
**Status:** Proposed
**Deciders:** Gideon

## Context

For this React Native canvas MVP, we need to expose native functionality to JavaScript efficiently. There are multiple approaches for creating native modules in React Native, with TurboModules and Nitro Modules being two main options. TurboModules are widely supported and stable, while Nitro Modules are newer and have limited adoption.

## Decision

We will use **TurboModules** for our native modules in this project.

## Rationale

- TurboModules have wider community and framework support, making them easier to implement and debug.
- As this is a first native portfolio project, stability and learning curve are important.
- TurboModules integrate well with JSI, which we plan to use for our canvas implementation.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Broad support in the React Native ecosystem.
- Easier onboarding and maintenance for future developers.
- Compatible with existing JSI-based workflows.

### Negative

- Slightly more boilerplate compared to experimental alternatives like Nitro Modules.
- May not leverage the very latest optimizations present in Nitro Modules.

### Neutral

- Performance differences between TurboModules and Nitro Modules are minimal for this MVP but may be worth revisiting for production-grade apps.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Nitro Modules

- A newer native module system for React Native that aims for more modern architecture.
- Not chosen due to limited support and potential instability for a first-time native project.

### Alternative 2: Plain Native Modules

- Standard approach for bridging native code without TurboModules or Nitro Modules.
- Not chosen because TurboModules provide better integration with JSI and future React Native architecture.
